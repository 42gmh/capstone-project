                During week 4 of the DigitalCrafts bootcamp one of the instructors recommended we do 
                the exercise that involved reproducing an 8-bit Mario. I have fond memories of playing 
                Mario with my little bother so I decided to do it. I enjoyed it so much that with each
                key technology we introduced, I decided to re-implement Mario using those lessons.
                I reproduced that exercise a total of four different ways.

                For my capstone project, I have decided to re-visit 8-bit Mario one last time -- this 
                time combining all the skills we leared to build an application that allows users to 
                create custom colored 8-bit Marios and store them in an album.
            </p>
        </div>
    );
